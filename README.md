# java-metaprogramming-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring the metaprogramming features of Java.

## Description

Metaprogramming is "programming the program". One of Java's key features is its dynamicness. There are things like the
Reflection API, Java agents, invokedynamic, Proxy, and annotation processing (often used for codegen). Together, these
tools enable metaprogramming for Java and other JVM languages. I would like to learn more about these tools so that I
can get even more leverage out of Java. In fact, the richness of these tools is a unique advantage of Java/JVM. Most
languages have fewer tools.

## Instructions

This project was developed on macOS and with Java 17.

1. Compile the program:
    * `./build.sh`
2. Run the program:
    * `./run.sh`

Alternatively, configure your favorite IDE (like Intellij) to look at the `src/` for the source code and use the IDE to
compile and run the program. Also, add `--enable-preview` to the VM and compiler flags.

## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Do something with classpath scanning. Can I find all classes that extend Record, for example?
* Do something with MethodHandles. No idea how this works.
* Do something with dynamic Proxies
* Do something with JSR-223 or JShell to execute dynaic code at runtime and somehow side-effect the program state. This
  is possible, right?
* IN PROGRESS Do something with Java agents (premain or dynamic)
  * Can I replace a method definition using the agent?

  * This is the only official Java document I can find on agents. I'm looking for more information and for examples. The
    OpenTelemetry project has a Java agent and the code is available at [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation) 
    on GitHub. It is ostensibly a good example of a sophisticated Java agent but there is little in the way of documentation
    that explains the implementation. Also we can count on Baeldung to have a [Guide To Instrumentation](https://www.baeldung.com/java-instrumentation)
    which shows a simple agent example!
